# Solar Panel Dashboard for Home Assistant (SunPower + InfluxDB)

![Dashboard Screenshot](screenshots/3.png)

A Home Assistant dashboard designed for **SunPower** PV systems, built using several HACS components, InfluxDB for data storage and a simple bash script for querying.

The dashboard visualizes solar panel production over time, allows you to browse historical data, and provides a live mode for up-to-date readings.

## ‚ú® Features

- üìä **Visualize a day's solar panel production** in a custom dashboard
- üìÖ **Select a date** to view historical data
- ‚è± **Select a time** using a 24-hour preview graph
- üîÑ **Toggle Live View** for the most recent data
- ‚ö° **Switch between Power and Energy** views
- üñ• **Timelapse Mode** (play through hourly values)

---

## üìñ What this is

- A **Home Assistant** dashboard for **SunPower** systems using the [krbaker/hass-sunpower](https://github.com/krbaker/hass-sunpower) HACS integration.
- A **bash script** (`query_panels.sh`) to query **InfluxDB** for power or energy values and save them for Home Assistant sensors.
- An **example Lovelace dashboard** (`dashboard.yaml`) that uses the queried data.  You need to customize your own panel layout.

---

## üö´ What this is not

- ‚ùå This code does **not** provide panel-level details you didn‚Äôt already have.
- ‚ùå This will **not** work without a functional [krbaker/hass-sunpower](https://github.com/krbaker/hass-sunpower) integration.
- ‚ùå It will **not** retroactively populate historical data ‚Äî InfluxDB will collect data going forward if its a first time setup.
- ‚ùå It will **not** automagically create your panel layout.  Use the example to customize your own placement.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

1. **Install Required HACS Integrations** (see Required Integrations above).

2. **Ensure InfluxDB is Running & Collecting Data**
---(This setup relies on InfluxDB v1.xx to store SunPower production data.  If already setup skip to: **Optional**.)
  - Install the InfluxDB Home Assistant add-on here: [Install InfluxDB](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/supervisor_addon/?addon=a0d7b954_influxdb&repository_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fhassio-addons%2Frepository).  If setting up InfluxDB for the first time, historical data starts from now onward.
  - Create at least 1 new user with **read/write** access to the "homeassistant" database. (e.g., `homeassistant`).
  - See the included **configuration.yaml** for a sample **INFLUXBD** configuration. Add to it your own configuration.yaml
     - Save the new username and password in secrets.yaml as
     ```
     influxdb_user: homeassistant
     influxdb_pass: yourpassword
     ```
  - Restart Home Assistant
  - **Optional:** create a new user with **read-only** access to the homeassistant database for the query_panels.sh script.  (e.g., `powermonitor`)

3. **Set up `query_panels.sh`**
  - Place the script in your Home Assistant config folder (e.g., `/config/scripts/query_panels.sh`).
  - Edit `query_panels.sh` and replace the InfluxDB connection information.
  ```
  INFLUXDB_HOST="localhost:8086"
       USERNAME="powermonitor"
       PASSWORD="password"
       DATABASE="homeassistant"
  ```
  - Check the **${DATA_DIR}** path works for your Home Assistant install. The included `configuration.yaml` entries will need an update if changed.
  ```
       DATA_DIR="/config/power"             ### files written by this script
       ENTITIES="${DATA_DIR}/entities.txt"
      GRAPH_OUT="${DATA_DIR}/graph.json"
     PANELS_OUT="${DATA_DIR}/panels.json"
  ```
  - Execution rights:   (e.g., `chmod +x /config/scripts/query_panels.sh`).
  - Run (`query_panels.sh --discover`) to attempt sensor discovery. If successful, it should print the sensor entities needed in configuration.yaml in next steps.
  ```
   /config/scripts/query_panels.sh --discover

Discovering lifetime_power and matching power sensors...

Found data for power_meter_pvs6mxxxxxxxxp_power matched from power_meter_pvs6mxxxxxxxxp_lifetime_power
Found data for inverter_e00122xxxxxxxxxx_power matched from inverter_e00122xxxxxxxxxx_lifetime_power

Use below in configuration.yaml for the timelapse_power_panels json_attributes

- power_meter_pvs6mxxxxxxxxp_power
- inverter_e00122xxxxxxxxxx_lifetime_power
- inverter_e00122xxxxxxxxxx_lifetime_power
...
  ```

4. **Update `configuration.yaml`**
  - Review `configuration.yaml`.  Add to your own Home Assistant configuration.yaml (sensors, inputs, shell commands).
  - Update any paths you may have changed for `query_panels.sh`.  Dont forget the **shell_command** points to the location of `query_panels.sh`.
  - Review `/config/power/entities.txt`, it should exist after running (`/config/scripts/query_panels.sh --discover`)
  - Replace the `json_attributes` in  **command: "cat /config/power/panels.json"** with the result of `query_panels.sh --discover`.
    ``` json_attributes:
        - inverter_e00122xxxxxxxxxx_lifetime_power
        - inverter_e00122xxxxxxxxxx_lifetime_power
        - inverter_e00122xxxxxxxxxx_lifetime_power
        - power_meter_pvs6mxxxxxxxxp_lifetime_power
    ```
    - Make sure all discovered entities are added.
  - Restart Home Assistant.

5. **Verify Data Flow**
  - Ensure `query_panels.sh` is successfully pulling data from InfluxDB.
  - Run `/config/scripts/query_panels.sh`for usage (e.g., `/config/scripts/query_panels.sh -d 2025-07-31 -h 14 -e inverter_e00122xxxxxxxxxx_power -m max -m power`).
  - Test a date and time with a specific entity (from the --discover output) to verify it produces a value response.
    - You will get empty values from dates that predate your InfluxDB setup.

6. **Import Automations and Scripts**
  - Add `automation_refresh_panels_onselect.yaml` to your automations
  - Add `automation_refresh_graph_onlive.yaml` to your automations
  - Add `script_panels_timelapse.yaml` to your scripts

7. **Load the Example Dashboard**
  - Copy `dashboard.yaml` to create a new dashboard.
  - Add it as a new dashboard in Home Assistant‚Äôs UI.
  - Review the notes in dashboard.yaml for customization (colors, thresholds, intervals)
  - Each Solar Panel is an individual card that needs to be associated with its corresponding sensor_id in the next step.

8. **Customize the Dashboard**
  - To accurately place the panels on the dashboard you must know their placement to begin with.  Consult your install documentation or the SunPower app to identify the location of each panel by serial number.
  - The sensor id names have changed over time but they are usually "power_8" (legacy) or "inverter_e00122xxxxxxxxxx_power" (new).
  - In `dashboard.yaml` match each panel (card) to its relevant  **power_key: power_8**  or  **power_key: inverter_e00122xxxxxxxxxx_power** entity_id.  Use the results from `query_panels.sh --discover`
  - Match the main production sensor to **power_key: **power** or **power_meter_pvs6mxxxxxxxxp_power**.
  - If you are using the legacy names, the device ID includes the serial number to help you identify each panel.
  - Remove or add any necessary cards to match your panel count.

## üß© Notes & Customization

- The bash script is designed for **krbaker/hass-sunpower** entities ‚Äî you may need to adjust entity names if using other integrations.
- This setup queries **historical** values provided by InfluxDB.  Without stored data, graphs and selections will be empty.
- `query_panels.sh` does not require write access.  You can use read-only permissions to the homeassistant database
